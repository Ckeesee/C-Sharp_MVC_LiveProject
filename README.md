# C-Sharp_MVC_LiveProject

For the last couple weeks of my time at the Tech Academy I had the opportunity to work on a live project with 4 others to create a website using Entity Framework as well as MVC and Visual Studio. I worked on a team to create a theatre website with producion members,photos, sponsor pages, and much more. The code base was C# but used razor through the html to excute C# code as well as Bootstrap and CSS to style the pages based on the client's preferences.

Below are descriptions of some of the stories/assignments that I worked on with some code snippets and links. I also have some full code files in ths rep for the larger funcionalites I implemented.
